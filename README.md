_**bCarbonZero**

A platform to connect volunteers and non-profits and incentivize service. Get tokens for volunteering and
trade tokens for products and discounts.

Utilized Python Flask for backend development to allow users to create an account, nonprofits to post their
volunteering opportunities, and volunteers to redeem tokens for completing said opportunities in order to
exchange them for discounts and products posted by vendors.

Used MySQL to design and integrate a database to store posting and user account information.
